[00:00] **Unknown**: We'll give it just a couple more minutes and then we'll get going.

[00:00] **Unknown**: Because it looks like most everybody's on besides mechanical, which is okay.

[00:00] **Unknown**: Hopefully everybody had a good Thanksgiving.

[00:00] **Unknown**: It's weird time of the year in Indiana, especially when you're trying to get stuff done between like now and New Year's.

[00:00] **Unknown**: I was looking at the schedule.

[00:00] **Unknown**: It looks like Christmas is on like a Thursday or something.

[00:00] **Unknown**: Then same with New Year's.

[00:00] **Unknown**: So it's going to be like pretty much a one day work week for everybody.

[00:00] **Unknown**: I appreciate everybody pushing through here.

[00:00] **Unknown**: We'll start with you, Jerome and Noah.

[00:00] **Unknown**: What I had from our meeting last week was I saw that you guys sent that updated CAD to.

[00:00] **1**: Yep.

[00:00] **Unknown**: Updated CAD to.

[00:00] **Unknown**: To Mark.

[00:00] **Unknown**: So hopefully we should have our layout solidified after this go around.

[00:00] **1**: Yeah, I had a meeting with him actually yesterday kind of offline.

[00:00] **1**: Just going through a couple.

[00:00] **1**: A couple little tweaks.

[00:00] **1**: That were a little bit bigger that.

[00:00] **2**: We wanted that I wanted to get.

[00:00] **1**: In front of the team here.

[00:00] **2**: A so a lot of the.

[00:00] **1**: I think the layout is good.

[00:00] **1**: The only, the only little shifts that we were kind of looking at are based on the.

[00:00] **1**: The window layouts in the.

[00:00] **1**: In the precast panels.

[00:00] **1**: So a confirm are we right now everything is set up based.

[00:00] **1**: You know we've got a 12 foot panel and I've limited it to three.

[00:00] **2**: Foot legs on the sides with a.

[00:00] **1**: Six foot opening in the middle.

[00:00] **2**: If that is.

[00:00] **2**: If that is the case then a.

[00:00] **1**: Can the mezzanine grow a couple feet to the north and that would be.

[00:00] **2**: Just to allow us to grab an extra.

[00:00] **2**: To grab some of the.

[00:00] **2**: Some of the window there and make it align.

[00:00] **1**: Well if it.

[00:00] **1**: If there's any flexibility in the panels to have those windows.

[00:00] **1**: Are we limited to the three foot legs or could there be.

[00:00] **2**: Could they notch and openings but basically.

[00:00] **1**: Connect between the windows would be the.

[00:00] **2**: The other thing that would allow us to kind of keep the layout as is.

[00:00] **Unknown**: Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and say no.

[00:00] **Unknown**: The mezzanine cannot grow.

[00:00] **Unknown**: So we have to Real, real mark in a little bit and I have my, my owner meeting tomorrow and so I'll let him know that.
