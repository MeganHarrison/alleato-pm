## Transcript


**0:**
Morning, guys. We'll give it a couple minutes here, we'll get going. Alrighty, we'll go ahead and get going here. Looks like we got HWC on. Jerome's here, county team is here and Steel services. Sweet. Okay, guys, so I want to start with, with structural. 
**1:**
Keith, I know we just found out. 
**0:**
Yesterday that our 50 foot by 54 foot grid is not going to work. So I don't expect you to have something obviously for this meeting. But when do you think you'll get some ideas for where we can have those last two column column lines lie and how that's going to affect us? 
**2:**
I have it sent over to the joist supplier to see what kind of price impact we have. Right now I've got it drawn up on a prelim to put line two inside that wall. So you'd have 58 and a half foot from inside to center wall and then 316 for the next space. One concern I do have is over on the right hand side, two grids in the column has shifted south by the filled boxes east of the machines. Well, southeast. Can we not get that column back on the grid? 
**0:**
Let me give me one second, Let me pull it up here. 
**2:**
Keith, you want me to share? 
**0:**
Yeah, if you could share your screen. 
**2:**
So this one's where I'm talking about. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Are you saying based off of his layout? 
**2:**
Yeah, yeah, on his cad. Come on, catch up. I got my mouse back. Go figure it freeze up on me here. There we go. Yeah, based on his cad, you can see where the, where the columns off this grid line. 
**0:**
Yeah, I mean, I, I, that may just be an error on his end. We're gonna have to keep that column in that line. That wouldn't make sense to have one offset like that. So I'll confirm, but I don't want that to hold you up. So, okay, if you put that back in your grid. 
**2:**
Yeah, right. 
**0:**
Compromise with him on that one. 
**2:**
Yeah. Right now Chuck has just a few minutes ago got this, but right now it's waiting to see what kind of impact it has. And then I haven't had a chance. 
**3:**
To talk to Chuck. 
**2:**
I know he's on, so I hadn't been able to get his input on it yet. 
**0:**
Okay, so, so you're just waiting to see cost impact then on that 58 foot? 
**1:**
Yep. 
**2:**
And then it looked like that dimension changed a little bit. So, yeah, cost impact for this 58 and the 31 offset. And then any additional squares of deck would be the, so main items, our. 
**0:**
Overall length should not have Changed. Are you pulling that from his PDF I sent you? 
**2:**
I'm pulling it from the CAD. 
**0:**
From the CAD? 
**1:**
Yep. Yeah. 
**2:**
The outside dimensions. Yeah. 4418 by 251.8. 
**1:**
4418 by. 
**2:**
251 8. 
**0:**
Yeah. We, we should be sticking to, to. 
**1:**
The, the original, the, the footprint that. 
**0:**
We, that dkgr had sent out. So I'm gonna get with Mark and see why his, why his distances have changed there. 
**2:**
Okay. 
**0:**
You said that's 4418 by what? 
**2:**
251 8. 
**0:**
251 foot 8. 
**2:**
Yeah. So we went up, whatever that is, 111,153 square feet. So we want a thousand square feet or one or two thousand square feet. 
**0:**
About three, actually. We were at 108. 
**2:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
So, but like I said, that's just. 
**2:**
Pulling off of what you sent over last night on this CAD file. 
**1:**
Yeah, it's interesting that, that I didn't. 
**0:**
Pull that dimension when I was looking at it. So I'll take a peek there. We'll wait on that cost impact. How are you. How are you moving along on your foundations? Obviously you need to know where these columns are lying to finalize that. But once we get a final. Hey, this is what the cost is going to be. We're going to put it in this wall. Do you think here in the next week you'll be able to have some 80% drawings I can share with precast? 
**2:**
Hey, Chuck. 
**4:**
Yeah, I guess that depends when we get stuff. I mean, we're going to need a few days just to get it drawn. Where do we stand on SOL report with this job? 
**0:**
I have one. 
**1:**
Okay, perfect. Yes, I do. Perfect. 
**0:**
Let me. I just got that. So I'll send, I'll put in my notes here to send you guys the geotag. 
**1:**
Okay, perfect. 
**4:**
Thank you. 
**0:**
We got a preliminary one done and so I have that I need to make sure that they have. I really just need a boring map attached to it so we can see where we're at on each bore. So I'll get that over to you. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**4:**
What is you guys. 
**1:**
What is you guys prep. 
**4:**
What is your preference for top of foundation as it relates to precast? Typically we put it down 12 inches, which is a good round number for the perimeter foundations. And that's assuming a 6 inch slab. I'm not sure what your assumed slab thickness is going to be either. 
**0:**
It'd be six inch slab. 
**4:**
Yeah. So with that being said, then we'll probably put top of foundations interior and exterior. Both at minus one foot zero. 
**0:**
Okay. You got that, Jerome, for your elevations? 
**1:**
Yep. 
**4:**
And do you know, maybe I missed this in the meeting notes, but do we know who the precaster is? 
**0:**
Yeah, County. County's doing a precast. 
**4:**
Perfect. 
**5:**
Perfect. 
**0:**
Thank you. And they are on this call. 
**5:**
Perfect. 
**0:**
Thank you. 
**4:**
When I hear County, I'm happy. 
**0:**
That's good. I want us to all get along. 
**1:**
So. 
**0:**
Anything else structural. 
**1:**
You give me that cost impact, I'll. 
**0:**
Confirm that that building did not grow. 
**1:**
Keith and Chuck today. 
**0:**
And then hopefully that should be what you guys need to start finishing things out. 
**1:**
Right? 
**2:**
Should be. Yeah. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**2:**
That and the geotech for. 
**4:**
Right. 
**5:**
For Chuck. 
**1:**
Yep. 
**2:**
I should have numbers tomorrow. Suppliers are off today for Veterans Day. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**2:**
But should have that feedback tomorrow for you. 
**0:**
Awesome. 
**1:**
Thank you, guys. 
**0:**
Anything else for structural. 
**4:**
This time? 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Hey, Jerome. I saw that Noah wasn't joining today. You saw my email yesterday? 
**1:**
Yep, yep, yep. 
**6:**
Soon as he gets in, I will check with him on making those. A couple of those last revisions that we had talked about yesterday. 
**0:**
Yep. Let's finalize those openings. And that way we have everything. 
**1:**
By. 
**0:**
The 17th for precast. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**5:**
And. 
**6:**
And we're just gonna assume that the building is not changed. That what I think we're. And we're just gonna assume that the perimeter is not changing at all. 
**2:**
Right? 
**1:**
I. Yes. 
**0:**
Yeah. Yes. I'm not sure I need to. I need to look into that, but I think that may just be an error on his end. If he was playing around with something. 
**6:**
Look like he just kind of grew it on the. On the left plan, left side to add some on some on wall racking there. 
**0:**
Right. And if he. And if he did, then that means that we're gonna. You know, we obviously want to add a panel in that 12 foot increment. So I just need to check to see. Make sure he didn't do that. Yeah. Okay. Okay, Alex, I see you're on here. You saw I sent you that topo cad. We're still waiting for that survey. I should get it here any day now this week. Is there anything else that you're needing besides. Besides that? 
**7:**
Just to confirm that the building footprint hasn't changed and none of the doors. 
**3:**
Moved or anything like that. 
**7:**
That would be great. I think the last building update we got was November 3rd. 
**1:**
Yep. 
**7:**
So just make sure that nothing on that end changed. 
**0:**
I did get a chance to look. 
**7:**
At the topo surface. Looks like the most low elevation on the site is actually on the west portion of the site. So we're looking at moving the pond from the east to the west. Unless you have any objections to that. 
**0:**
Yeah, I'm not sure where we had that. I know we have it planned south. Right. And I don't know if we indicated where exactly, but. Yeah, the west portion is the lowest. Let's keep it there on the west. 
**2:**
Okay. 
**7:**
But other than that. 
**0:**
So we did confirm. We will need a. Like a dry detention. 
**2:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**7:**
And then can you send the geotech to us as well? 
**0:**
I will get that out to everyone. 
**2:**
Okay. 
**7:**
I think that's all we would need. 
**0:**
Okay. Okay. Anything else for civil? 
**7:**
Not that I can think of. 
**0:**
Awesome. Thank you, Alex. 
**4:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Okay, moving on to precast. Brett, I see you're on here. 
**1:**
Yep. 
**8:**
And I think Ozzy was too a minute ago. 
**0:**
Yep, I see Ozzy as well. Well, right now we're. We're pushing hard to get you what you guys need. So those 80 drawings for structural. And then. And then confirming openings for. From an architectural standpoint, I think. Brett, when you and I talked, we're. We're banking on getting all this in here in the next week cup. You know, make sure we get it in next week at the latest. That way we can hit our timeline for our pre cast slot. So I'll be pushing hard to get that to you guys here. Okay. 
**1:**
Sounds good. 
**3:**
Hey, A.J. yeah, I'll introduce myself and Partha. I'm a kriften. I'm with county engineering. My team. My team will be performing the engineering on this job, just FYI. 
**0:**
Perfect. 
**3:**
Awesome. 
**0:**
Thank you for joining. So I'm not sure how much Brett has let you know, but we're gearing up for getting you guys everything you need next week so we can get rolling on those shop drawings. 
**3:**
Yep, sounds good. 
**0:**
Any questions for me and the team. 
**3:**
Bracing for this job? Do we know if we're going to be using Deadman or we're going to be using helical? Because you mentioned geotech. You mentioned. You mentioned geotech report. So that's why I was kind of curious because that'll be of use to us depending on what kind of bracing we're going to do on this job. 
**8:**
Partha, I believe it was sold as just regular Ford Dead men. 
**3:**
Deadman. Okay. 
**0:**
Yeah, I. I hadn't looked and seen what you guys included Brandon was dealing with with Lenny on all of that, so. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**2:**
Sounds good. 
**3:**
Buried, I assume, Brett. 
**4:**
Say again? 
**3:**
Barry Deadman, right? 
**8:**
Yes. Correct. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Okay. I did have one question. So I. I was. We're changing up or we're still working through Our MEP design, it's my understanding that we can go up to a nine foot opening in this precast after the fact. Right. So let's say we have to pass through like our biggest duct is going to be, you know, 50 inches by 50 inches. Is there any reason why we can't, if we don't have those locations solidified, why we can't cut that in after the fact? And if we have to throw some steel on the inside, we do. 
**3:**
I, I would say that's probably too big of an opening to be doing post engineering. So. Okay. You know, anything up to like a 12 by 12 opening size. 12 inch by 12 inch opening size is, is usually fine. You know, generally it's around like a 9 inch diameter openings and things like that. But you can cut. And we will give you in our shop drawings, as part of our shop drawings, the safe zones so that you're not like, so that you're not cutting through strands and things like that. So we can give you, you know, those locations and maximum, maximum cores that you can do. But I would say, you know, the sooner we get MEP on board and get them to coordinate with us, you know, what openings they need, where they need and things like that, the better it is for the job. I mean, I can't tell you how many, you know, how many jobs they usually come back so late in the game and it's just a pain for everybody at that time. 
**1:**
Right, right. And we, yeah, yeah, we have a. 
**0:**
Tight timeline so we'll try to get you those. I mean, I'm not, I may not have them next week, but you should have enough to start your shop drawings in here by the end of next week or maybe two weeks from today. I will have, we will make an effort to get you exactly where those openings are. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
And, and we could do like a weekly or a bi weekly coordination meeting with the design team once the MVP is on board. And kind of we're going to be doing everything on Revit. Right. So we could be, we could be modeling those openings and everything into coordinating all that and looking for flash detections and things like that too, with them. So I would, I would strongly suggest that we do something like that as part of our coordination process before we join in the submittal. That way everybody can see what the openings are, where they are and then comment on it, move them around, add more, whatever, and we can implement all those. 
**0:**
I'll put it, I'll put it. So we, we already have the, the H VAC design Okay. On board. So I'll just put an e, an email together with you guys and, and we'll get a meeting set up here. I, I'm traveling to a job site this afternoon and tomorrow so I'll be out. So it'll probably be like Monday next week. Okay. 
**3:**
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, yeah, I mean we could definitely talk about it next week too. But you know, the best timing would be, you know, once we have some sort of a semblance of a model put together on revit and that way people, we can kind of fly the team through it and then we can look at different situations and look at opening sizes in relation to, you know, doctor Openings and joints and things like that. 
**1:**
Yep, perfect. 
**0:**
Matt, I see you're on with pointer. I'm going to put a follow up schedule. I don't know if you saw the emails about code that we were bouncing back and forth, but I'm going to put a follow up design meeting with us and then maybe we can get county in on that. But definitely want to get Jerome in on that with dkgr. That way we can confirm building classification, which I think we have. Right. Jerome. And then, and then M A can get rolling. I, I hope they saw. I, I sent those STS sheets to them. Did you, did you get that? 
**5:**
Yeah. And Bruce is on right now. I don't know if they've had any questions or anything just yet. It was on. 
**0:**
Okay. I just want to make sure I'm giving you guys what you need. 
**5:**
So yeah, they're reviewing that and trying to make sure we're, we're lining up with that building code. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
And I really do like the idea. I was talking with Brandon a little bit about adding maybe some smaller exhaust fans. That way we don't have those hot spots instead of just two massive ones like we had originally planned on. I don't know. But it's definitely something to explore. 
**5:**
Okay. 
**0:**
As long as it's cheaper. 
**5:**
Right. Okay. We'll look into that side and on those wall openings. I've got a drawing marked up for the supply openings from the units and it was kind of based on what we found out on this exhaust. So I may have to do two scenarios but at least we can get that coordination started on the wall openings once we see the model. Maybe first of the week. 
**0:**
Awesome. Okay guys. Short to the point. That's how I like them. Any questions for me? I got a little homework. I'll get you guys this Geotech especially. 
**3:**
That was good. Thank you. 
**0:**
All righty guys. Have a Good one. 
**7:**
Thanks, A.J. 
**4:**
Thanks. 
**7:**
See you guys. 
**0:**
See you.
