## Gist
The meeting focused on confirming survey data and coordinating architectural, structural, and MEP designs to ensure timely project progress.

## Short Summary
The team confirmed that the survey data is complete, resolving boundary discrepancies and allowing civil tasks to proceed. AJ Taylor emphasized the urgency of finalizing boundary data to meet the end-of-year deadline in six weeks. Architectural plans are narrowing, with office space reduced from 4,000 to 2,600 square feet, and layouts being finalized for owner approval. The structural team is targeting an 80% completion of drawings to initiate precast fabrication, while geotech data remains pending but won't delay progress. MEP coordination requires Revit and CAD files for alignment with architectural plans, and a life safety zoning meeting is scheduled. Timely sharing of CAD and Revit files with county officials is crucial for maintaining permitting momentum, and strong communication is emphasized across teams to meet project timelines.

**0:**
Hey, everybody. We'll give it a couple minutes here and then get going. Alrighty. How's everybody doing? So I want to say I apologize and I appreciate everybody. Everybody's patience on that geotech I thought I had. Which we don't yet supposed to have it today. So stay tuned and we will have that. I'm looking at some other things that were in my court. That was the survey. Is Alex on here? 
**1:**
No, I'm. 
**2:**
I'm filling in for him today. 
**0:**
Okay. Hey, Chad. 
**3:**
Hey. 
**0:**
I sent Alex a note yesterday. So the survey we got, we had some discrepancy on whether a line was capped. We did find out that it was capped. So the survey we have should be good to go. And so Alex should have everything he needs. We'll just start here with civil. I gave him the topo. He has the survey. Is there anything else you guys are waiting on, Chad, that you know of now? 
**2:**
I think. I think we can kind of proceed. I just. I guess. Are we getting a CAD file with the actual boundary? Is that still coming? 
**0:**
I thought it was on that. It should be on that topo cat I sent. 
**2:**
Is it? Okay, I will verify and let you know if it's different than that. 
**0:**
Yep, verify and let me know. 
**2:**
Go. 
**0:**
And. And we'll go. We'll go from there. 
**2:**
Okay, Sounds good. 
**3:**
Yep. 
**2:**
No, we should have everything we need to kind of get going on this. 
**0:**
Sweet. Sweet. And hopefully. I know Alex sent me a note. I think it was either Friday or maybe it was Monday. I forget pushing saying that we needed that info to kind of finalize and be able to meet this deadline, hopefully by the end of the year. So puts us at about six weeks. So I'll just. I'll check in here and make sure you just let me know if you don't have that boundary and I'll get it to you today. 
**2:**
All right, Sounds good. Appreciate it. 
**0:**
Alrighty. Sweet. Okay, Moving on here to see dkgroup is on yesterday. Guys, I sent you a note about stepping down our precast now for our load. Did that make sense, what I was sending over, how we need that to look fall on the slope of the. 
**4:**
Roof that's been made and the office mezzanine was changed over, so. 
**0:**
Okay. Okay. So we should have all of our openings solidified then. 
**1:**
And. 
**0:**
From an architectural standpoint, let's. If you could send out a PDF of that and the cads, and then we'll get those in county's hands, make sure that they don't need anything else. From an architectural standpoint, And then I would get going then on a finalizing an office layout. Noah. That way we can get the blessing from the owner. He wanted 4,000 square foot. Obviously he's not going to get that with what we have. He's getting 2,600 of office. But I think we'll see what he says and we'll go from there. Is there anything else you're needing right now to continue with your work? 
**4:**
No, should cover it. 
**0:**
Did you get that CAD layout of his new interior based off of our column lines? 
**4:**
Yeah, that should all be. That should all be finalized with the. Essentially that new layout with the bay. Well, I'll send that out with the new. The updated plans here in bed with that middle bay shrunk down so that we can fit their racking layout. 
**5:**
Perfect. 
**0:**
Yeah, it should all be based on a 50 by 50 grade. Working from it'd be the east plan, east end to the west end. Anything else for architecturals? Awesome. Okay, let's move on to structural. I see. Is Keith on here? 
**1:**
Yep, I'm here. And it looks like Chuck's on also. 
**0:**
Awesome. Hey, Keith, I know we were firing off a bunch of emails yesterday. I appreciate the quick responses. What I have in my court right now is needing that geo. That final Geotech, obviously. I saw an email about needing the fork information. I don't have that right now. Is that going to hold up your design or do we have enough that we can get it into our precast guys hands and they can start their shops? 
**1:**
I'll leave that to Chuck on. 
**3:**
Yeah, that's the foundation slab. Information is not going to affect the precasters. 
**2:**
No. 
**0:**
Okay. Okay. Do you know when we will have those 80% drawings, Chuck? 
**3:**
Well, I think we can have those assuming all those questions were answered from yesterday on girder depths and clearance questions. I think we're. I think we're just about there. 
**1:**
Yeah, yeah, the. Yeah, we're. We were down to the Geotech. The forklift and the rack questions are the only thing we're I think left with Chuck. 
**3:**
Yeah, and that kind of stuff is not going to affect precast. It's the top of precast, which I noticed was all at 34. So we're assuming that's been dropped appropriately so that. So we don't have any heavy drifting on the joist. The bearing elevations are as we have indicated on our current plans. If all that's good with everyone and then the steel clearances underneath them, then you know we're in really, really good shape. So. 
**0:**
Awesome. Well then what I need from. From you guys and from dkgroup is those drawings to a point today, cad, PDF, whatever county needs sent out and then that way they can get going on their shops. 
**3:**
Yep. And County's new system, they always have a lot of questions for us, but they'll go back and forth with Greg at my office. Yeah, and that's fine, but. And we're used to that, but just have them, just tell them don't hesitate to reach out to the structural guys and get all your little P's crossed and I's dotted and we're pretty quick to respond to what they need. 
**0:**
Perfect. Besides that Geotech, Chuck, which I will get to you. Terracon's supposed to have it to them today. They said. Is there anything else that's in my court or in someone else's court that you need? 
**3:**
Well, like I've been asking, I always like to look at the slab and design that slab and make sure that the 6 inch slab can carry the, the racking propose and carry the fork trucks they want to drive around the place. 
**0:**
Yeah, I'll get those. Yeah, I'll get those submittals too. I forgot that one. I got that written down here so. 
**3:**
It doesn't take us too long to check that. But it's. It's better to check it than to, you know, better to be safe than sorry. So. 
**0:**
For sure. For sure. Okay, county team, I see. See a couple of you on here. Brett, I saw you just responded to my email. I'd like to get a meeting put together between you guys and our MEP guy. Matt Hamilton's on here with Pointer and just solidify as you guys start working on your shop drawings this week. Solidify where our, our openings are going to be for. For ductwork and for our exhaust fans. Other than that, I think. I think we'll be. That'll cover all the openings and today you'll get what you need from. From dkgroup and what you need from. From Steel Services and should hopefully have everything that you guys need. 
**5:**
Understood. 
**0:**
Any questions for anyone in here? 
**6:**
AJ on that note, I'm going to need the Revit files for the structural and architectural, those kind of things to try to put our information on. So if that's coming from dkgroup or whom that might be coming from, if we can get on that list to get access to it. 
**3:**
We don't do Revit. We're going to send AutoCAD out to everybody. 
**6:**
Okay. 
**3:**
AJ, this is Chuck. I do have one simple question. What are we calling this set I know. We're dating it today. What is the name of the set in the title block? Is this a bid set or what? Are we actually calling these drawings today? 
**0:**
That's a good question. I don't know. 80%. If they're actually 80%, I call them. It's enough to get my precast guys going on their shop. So we meet our dates. That's what I'm calling them. 
**3:**
Well, okay, we'll just call it the 80% set then. 
**0:**
Yeah, that works. Okay. Alrighty, guys. Yeah, Matt, we'll get those revit and CAD files sent out to you. I'll make sure you get them. Well, 15 minutes. That's how I like it. Any. Any more questions? 
**6:**
Yeah, I do have a couple. We can either at least bring it up and start talking about it or do an offline meeting here. But we need to get with the architectural group, I'm guessing whoever's laid out, like the life safety, zoning and the planning, and try to check code compliance. Because for us to try to match up an outside person trying to meet that H occupancy, we gotta make sure that we're in alignment on the mechanical side. Who would that info be coming through? Do you know? 
**0:**
So it'd be me. And then Noah and Jerome are on here, dkgroup. So we'll get something set up in a different meeting, guys, this week. I'll put an email thread together, Matt, like I did with the county team. And. And we'll get. We'll get. Get something on the schedule. 
**1:**
A.J. 
**5:**
This is B.J. from Muscat. Nicholas, hey. When you're rounding up stuff, and forgive me if it was in the earlier batch of info, I can't get my computer to come on this morning. But we'll want to see the SDS sheets for the materials being stored. We've got to verify density of the vapors coming off the material. And then I think that code summary that you had sent previously, did it indicate if the quantities being stored were beyond maximums for control zone areas? Have you guys looked at that? 
**0:**
I believe it did, pj. And I think I sent the SDS sheets, too. It would have been in a link, so I'll make sure I send those out to you guys again. 
**5:**
Okay? All right. Sorry. I would have looked myself, but I can't. No, you're good blind without a computer at the moment, so I do have. 
**0:**
All that info, so. 
**5:**
Okay. 
**0:**
All right. 
**5:**
Yeah, once we've got all that, then we can guide Matt on. On this. We definitely can't pull exhaust through the building. Like, we were originally thinking, it's got to be space by space, we're not allowed to recirc. 
**0:**
Right. And I think Matt sent. He sent me a layout a little bit earlier, which we've been bouncing back and forth on. So I think that makes sense too, for those hotspots we were talking about maybe having with two big exhaust fans. So, yeah, I don't hate the idea. 
**7:**
Hey, real quick, this is Partha with County. Can we also get on the list of receiving those CAD and revit files, please, for our reference? 
**0:**
Yep. We'll send them out to everybody. 
**7:**
All right, sounds good. Thank you. 
**0:**
All righty, guys. Anybody else? 
**5:**
Nope. 
**0:**
Alrighty. Well, have a good rest of your day and we'll be in contact. Okay, sounds good. 
**3:**
Perfect. 
**0:**
Thank you, guys. Thanks.
