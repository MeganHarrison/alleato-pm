**0:**
On. What you say? 
**1:**
Long time no see. 
**0:**
I know, man. 
**1:**
Mark doesn't usually get on this call, right? 
**0:**
No, Mark does not get on this call. 
**1:**
That's what I thought. Sorry. I just sent that. A revised office layout. 
**0:**
I saw that. Yeah. I was a little, a little worried at first that it wasn't fitting in. 
**2:**
Our. 
**0:**
Our mezzanine like size that we have structural released on. But I think it does and if it doesn't, we need to shrink it down. 
**1:**
The only thing that like, I think what I was looking at was maybe moving the north wall maybe a foot just to get those, just to get it to align with the windows. But if we need to sit it exactly that we're going to have to. 
**0:**
Sit it down just to make sure it falls in. And Keith's mezzanine. So those structural drawings are in that, that folder. Jerome. And you'll be able to see it where that's fallen. I'll give you like two more minutes, guys. 
**3:**
Sa. 
**4:**
Hey, aj, this PJ. 
**0:**
Hey, what's up PJ? 
**4:**
Hey. We kicked around fire rated walls yesterday. Where is that? Are they on a drawing now? That is out there that I can use as a reference point. 
**0:**
So yeah, let's just go ahead and jump into it. Good question. We'll start with architectural. Jerome and Noah. So we got the updated CAD from the owner. I saw that you guys already switched some things around. The only thing I just want to confirm is that. I want to confirm that the layout fits in our structural mezzanine. Okay. So I saw it was like three inches longer. It looked like when I just did a brief measurement. So we just need to reel that in because we're not changing it at this point. That's the size we're getting. Okay. 
**1:**
Yeah, that's easy. That was, that was on. That was me making that, making that one a little change. 
**5:**
So. 
**1:**
And again, that was once we kind of. That's, you know, getting. We've got windows in there. So windows can, can shift a little bit. But I'm trying to get everything to work, obviously look good from the exterior, have everything aligned up there. And so there's just, there's a little bit of. But that should be, that should be an easy, that should be an easy, easy fix. 
**0:**
Okay. And then to PJ's question, we talked about those rated walls, right? We have that one demising wall that's a four hour wall and everything to the left is going to be four hour and then all the other walls are going to be two hour. If you can, if you can get those marked on a drawing with this updated layout and then get the elevations updated. I know we like added a punched opening or two, so I can get those to the pre cast guys. You know, short week, obviously. I don't want anyone working over Thanksgiving if they don't have to. Is that something that you guys think you can change in the next couple days and get that on paper here? 
**1:**
Yep. 
**0:**
Okay, so I'm just going to mark here before Thanksgiving, updated layouts. 
**4:**
So is the wall around the process room, guys, is that a four hour wall? I. It's just rated. I don't care whether two hour or four hour. 
**0:**
Right, right. You're talking about this right here, P.J. 
**5:**
Yeah. 
**4:**
All the way around the perimeter of the process. 
**2:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Two hour. This is, this is our four hour wall. And then everything to the left. And it's not a code requirement. 
**4:**
Right. 
**0:**
This is an owner. 
**4:**
Well, here's where we're going to get stuck, guys. If you put it on a drawing and say it's rated, I cannot put a fire damper in it. A transfer through a wall is a duct. It conveys air. It's a tube or a conduit for the passage of air. And if you think about this on a hazardous exhaust system, you don't want to block the flow with anything. So that, that's why it's in the code, so that you can't do that. So the. We'll come up with an approach on how to exhaust this stuff. But I just needed to make sure if they're rated and you're doing it for loss prevention or at the owner's request, if they're not required by code, that's great. We can work around it with, with some duct work to get the exhaust and the supplier that we want the way we want to do it. But just know that we can't put a smoke damper or fire damper in a transfer. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**4:**
Through a rated partition. 
**0:**
Smoke or fire damper. In a rate. You said in a rate. In any of those rated walls. 
**4:**
Any. Well, any. Well, we can't. 
**3:**
Here's. 
**4:**
Yeah. Because we wouldn't use if it wasn't rated. We wouldn't put a fire smoke damper in it. Right. It would just be a transfer grill. 
**0:**
Right on that. 
**3:**
All right. 
**4:**
And. But if it's essentially, you can't put a fire or smoke damper in a hazardous exhaust duct and an opening in a wall is a duct and we call it a grill, you're not running 100ft of duct, but the six inches of the wall, the eight inches, the four inches, that's an air passage, which is technically a duct. So you can't, you can't put that in there because of the potential for it to close. And then you don't get airflow. And it's hazardous exhaust. It has to be unobstructed airflow all the way to the exit point of the building. And then you run into other parameters of duct design in, in rated spaces. But we can make this work with. 
**0:**
We run into PJ if we mark that as a rated wall, then when we're getting our inspections, fire marshal is going to see, hey, why? 
**4:**
You know. 
**5:**
Yeah. 
**4:**
And what you run into is, you know, the whole building's H3, so you don't have to have these rated walls, but you start to do it from a loss prevention and, you know, the perspective of life safety as well. I mean, the code's going to dictate some of it. But if you, if you're saying they're not required, then we're doing it for a reason. It's probably loss prevention. 
**0:**
It is for that, yes. 
**4:**
Okay, so then we just adjust the design of the exhaust system to accommodate that, which isn't a big deal. It's just the number of drops and the number of fans. And Matt and I are headed down that road now to be able to make this work with the way the rate of partitions are. 
**3:**
So. 
**4:**
Okay, I just wanted to verify that we'll keep moving so that we've got a preliminary idea of how to do this for next week. The next thing I'm going to look at is the air changes. You know, there's an OSHA element to this. The code says one minimum of one CFM a foot. We have to understand the off gassing and make sure that we're providing enough air changes for OSHA requirements. 
**0:**
Right, right. I know we're gearing up kind of towards the fifth to have this initial idea. PJ that's still realistic. Right. 
**4:**
We're going to try the, the layout of it and how to do it. The air volumes and duct sizing and stuff. I, you know, I won't. I doubt I have that done by then. The exhaust fans. Go ahead, Matt. 
**6:**
Is what we plan to submit. 
**0:**
Say that again. 
**6:**
The exhaust concept is what we plan to submit. Make sure that the road we're headed down is what is going to be what the user needs. 
**0:**
Okay. So by the fifth, we'll have the exhaust concept. How. Assuming all. In a perfect world, everything looks good with what you Guys, propose. Which I'm assuming it will. How soon can you get me duct sizing and opening locations. After that fifth date we got. 
**4:**
It's the air changes on that. 
**3:**
That. 
**4:**
That are going to. Going to drive that. And it also drive the confirmation of the air handlers as well. So probably the following. 
**0:**
That puts us at the 9th or 10th. 
**6:**
It's probably the next Tuesday or Wednesday that I can. 
**5:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Can we say the ninth? 
**4:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**6:**
That means by the end of the day on the 5th or no later than early morning on Monday, we need the approval that this concept is the right approach. 
**0:**
Yeah, yeah, we'll get that. We'll get that to you. I don't want you waiting on me, so. Go ahead, Ozzy. 
**4:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
For the fire rating, does that affect any other precast? No. Okay. 
**0:**
No, Ozzy. The only thing that's affecting precast right now. And I guess anything on the mechanical side, guys. Anything else? 
**4:**
No, let's. Well, we'll look at concept. What's most efficient from a cost and installation standpoint on where do we mount the fans at, Whether they're high and less exterior stack duct work. And we do more on the inside or put the fan down low and have more duct on the outside. Matt's guys will figure that out. 
**5:**
It's. 
**4:**
I'll focus on the. On the air volume for that. Okay. 
**0:**
Yeah. I mean, it makes. It would make sense. Right? 
**4:**
Go ahead. I was going to ask A.J. do you have. From the owner, the. Do they have a user requirement for each space for H VAC performance? 
**3:**
Is that. 
**4:**
Is that written down anywhere? I've been piecemealing it from these talks, but if there was a document that it existed on, whether it's what you guys proposed to the owner and said, we're going to give you a space that does this. I like to make sure I haven't missed anything in our calculations for that, so. 
**0:**
Yeah. You're talking about per space. 
**2:**
Yeah. 
**4:**
Temperature and humidity requirements for each space. 
**1:**
I know Brandon had that one markup we look at. 
**0:**
Yeah, We. We have that on that. Buster. 
**1:**
A couple of those bases. 
**0:**
Yeah, P.J. we have that. I'll send that to you. Okay. 
**4:**
Okay. I just thought. I just want to make sure we're in alignment on it because it. It'll play into our concept for next week. Yep. 
**0:**
Yeah, I'll send that to you. Okay. Anything else for mechanical. 
**4:**
The other ancillary spaces, like the maintenance, mechanical room and stuff. Ventilation and heat only on those. Or we want to air condition them. 
**0:**
I don't think they need to be air conditioned. Brandon, what do you think? 
**5:**
Well, let's call each specific room, right? So mechanical room, electrical room. Just do a standard setup for like you would any other warehouse. So it'll just have a little heating unit, you know, or whatever that is to keep everything from freezing. Now the QC lab, you will need to. To put some AC in. I believe you'll have to double check. Aj, I'm pretty sure he called. He called that on something he wanted. And then the label, storage. I can't remember again. Aj, you need to double check that document if that needs to be conditioned or not. Yeah, those little rooms. But as far as the mechanical electrical, just do again a little resin or heater type thing, right. 
**4:**
And. All right, we'll do. In summertime, we'll do ventilation on a thermostat. It gets above 80 degrees and the fan comes on. Louver opens. 
**5:**
Are you gonna dump that outside or. 
**4:**
Yeah, that's just. Yeah, that'll just be through. You can't vent it back to us. But we'll have to. Have to go to the exterior. So be a through wall propeller fan and an intake ideally at the opposite corner of the space. Just mechanical room ventilation. It's not a big deal. 
**5:**
Is that typical? I don't know how much I've seen that, to be honest. 
**4:**
Well, you have. You have to ventilate it. We can tie it to one of the air handling units so we have all the air changes. You can go to that and then we can put a little bit of exhaust in the room to get rid of it. But typically what we would do is just. You just have an outdoor air louver and an exhaust fan for just summertime cooling to keep it from. You know, typically you can run about ambient plus 10 as a max in the space with. If you're. If you've got a. A ventilation fan going on it. And then you close that in the winter and you have your resonator. 
**5:**
I mean, with us doing the. The way I think our. We're doing, you know, our H Vac for the whole building, I think it would be cleaner to just do that exhaust ventilation. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**5:**
Not. Not tied into the units, right? 
**4:**
Yeah, yeah, just that room would be by itself just to have a little outdoor air intake on it. Little louver opens up and. 
**5:**
Yeah, it doesn't take. 
**4:**
Take a lot. That's just another opening of the precast we need to account for. 
**5:**
Yeah, but it's only like a 3 inch one or something, right? Or 6 inch. 
**4:**
No, it'll be bigger more like a 3 foot by 3 foot or maybe a 4x4. 
**5:**
Oh, and yes, yes, we do need to count for that. 
**3:**
Are the. 
**4:**
Do the compressors live in there? They live somewhere else. Where's the. I guess I'll need to kind of know what kind of equipment's going to be in there. Brandon. 
**0:**
Compressors. Brandon. Didn't we have a marked location on here for those? 
**3:**
We. 
**5:**
Well, and originally we just had them kind of up here in the. In that corner and where the mechanical room and stuff is. Do you. I would. I would think what I. You know, which we. We need to put that on the note to lay out a compressor. 
**4:**
Jerome. 
**5:**
But my thought is we would put it, you know, right. Kind of in that little void between the label sample storage and mechanical room, just right along that exterior wall or something. 
**4:**
Okay. Do they use a lot of compressed air? Brandon? It was a very big compressor that you're gonna. 
**5:**
Yeah, he said 150 horsepower compressor. 
**0:**
So there's gonna be airlines running throughout all this equipment. 
**4:**
Right now I'm just thinking about. So you're gonna have air intake air exhaust off that compressor. If you, if you, if you let it run on the inside of the building for its intake and exhaust. They're just. They're loud. So you might be thinking about that piece of equipment as another penetration through your precast. And then if it's out there in that little alcove right there, your, your once through air and cooling will take care of any heat gain in the space from that piece of equipment. But your piece of equipment might want a direct intake and exhaust line to the exterior. 
**5:**
So I, I guess what we're. I think what you're suggesting is basically like on the north side of that bottle label line right there on the exterior. Putting it out there and then stubbing in. 
**4:**
Yeah, you can buy an exterior compressor and dryer. Just all how they're rated and set up. The equipment skid you buy just then. Sometimes if it's, you know, if it's air cooled, it might want a ducted intake. I'm doing one right now at Rolls. That's that way. And I think It's a. It's 150 or 200 horsepower. So it's similar deal. 
**0:**
How big is that PJ floor space, do you know? 
**4:**
It takes up all the dry. It's got. We got super dry air minus 40. There's a bunch of ancillary equipment for it. It's about a 12 foot by 20 foot alcove. We. We took to put all this stuff in, it's got heat recovery on the. So it takes in air for its cooling. It's air cooled compressor. And then it's got an exhaust duct on it. In the exhaust duct we've got a series of dampers to grab that exhaust air and use it for heat in the winter. But this, this isn't a vertical unit. Like you know, like even like you'd see an industrial shop. It's bigger. Right. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
We'll get. I think Brandon, we need to dive in. Get some more requirements from Mark on that. 
**5:**
Yeah, yeah, definitely. 
**0:**
So I'm making a note here on that. I don't want to. Trying to keep these within our 30 minutes time. So. So PJ if you have any more questions, we'll. We can do a one off and. 
**4:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Go from there. I want to move on to precast. Ozzy, I see you. You're on here. How are. How are things looking right now? I know we started that five week kind of time clock last week. Do you guys. When can I expect kind of a. 
**1:**
First. 
**0:**
Go around on these shops? How are we tracking? 
**3:**
Looks like by the end of December we'll start seeing the approvals that. Okay. 
**0:**
Or take so into December. I'm looking at my calendar here. Obviously Christmas is tough, right? Falling in the middle of the week. Is there a way we can see something by the 19th and just see where we're. Where you're at or maybe even give you two weeks because I know um, we like added a window Ozzie or two and so I need to get those to you guys and I don't expect any more changes after that. Besides obviously where our duct is passing through the building and our exhaust fans and. And we're trying to get those to you like next week. But other than that you should have everything you need. Right? 
**3:**
Right. Correct. So right now I'm projecting to erect the building 316. Is that. That's still correct? 
**0:**
Yeah, we're pushing towards it. You know, Alex isn't on here with civil, but we're at a good spot structurally to. To submit to the. To the state for our early foundation release. The next step really is just getting our civil tidied up so we can start pushing dirt. 
**5:**
And. 
**0:**
And the goal is to be pushing dirt end of January which would get us or you know, give us four weeks to push dirt. Dig some footers. Like I think we're. We're tracking towards that Ozzy. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
So if you don't mind, can I. Can I mark in my notes here, maybe I Could see something here. We'll call it the. The 19th. 
**3:**
We could try. I mean, I don't want to promise anything. We do have time on this job. Right Now I'm projecting 316 to a wreck. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**3:**
So as long as it doesn't slip, I'm fine on my end. 
**0:**
I know. I think Brett may have just scared me just a tad when he was like, hey man, we got to move on this. And so we've been, you know, balls to the wall and getting you guys everything you need. So if you're. If you're telling me 316 erection date, I'm going to mark that down here. Okay. 
**3:**
Yeah. That's what I have in my schedule. 316 and then. 
**0:**
And then shop drawings for review by end of December. 
**3:**
Yeah, One week for review. 
**0:**
End of December, one week for review. And then so what does that put our precast slot at our production slot. 
**3:**
It's not that many pieces. I think we're only have on this job. 117 pieces. 
**0:**
Yeah, that sounds right. 
**3:**
So we'll start producing around the second week of the beginning of the month of next year. Okay. 
**0:**
Okay. Awesome. 
**5:**
I mean, shoot. I would think that you would run these panels and a week, wouldn't you, Ozzy? 
**3:**
Yeah, we could produce it in one week. I don't see why we couldn't. 
**5:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
As long as they have the tickets. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**5:**
The main thing is just I guess you gotta get the shops and get all your rebar and everything, all that Orderock. 
**3:**
Right. 
**0:**
Okay. Anything else, Ozzy? From. From Precast. You good? 
**3:**
Nothing from us. We're good. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Civil. It doesn't look like anyone from hwc is on, so I'll call them and get. Get some updates and send these meeting minutes out. Keith, you're on with structural. How are we looking? We got that 80% set. What do you need from me? 
**2:**
I don't think there's anything we need at this time. I didn't get a chance to check to see if we're any further along than that 80% set. But I mean it's pretty much there. 
**3:**
So. 
**2:**
Really comes down. 
**0:**
Does it. 
**2:**
Anybody need anything from us? 
**0:**
I know Partha from Precast. He had a couple things I noted back here, so I'll get with you in an email. I don't think it's. It's too critical. The biggest thing was like a rebar layout on your footer. When we do we have some sanitary that may run through there. So just making sure we don't hit any of that So I guess when. When do you think you can have, like, hey, hey, Leo, here's. Here's your final set ready for submission. And we'll. We can review it and then say, yep, everything's good. 
**2:**
And I would think we're pretty stinking close, but let me get Chuck and see how his cat jockeys are doing on putting it on paper or, you know, getting ready for paper. And I will get you an answer hopefully today. 
**5:**
But. 
**0:**
Okay, let's. Let's shoot for the 9th. That's two weeks from now. I. I figured that'd be plenty of time get through Thanksgiving okay. 
**4:**
Yep. 
**2:**
I don't see any issue with that, but. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Okay, Jerome. We kind of touched on it at the beginning. 
**5:**
Hey, real quick, Keith, as far as. So hearing that three, six, erection date, and I think they've got five days or something, maybe six, that they're going to take to set these panels. That puts you at the second week of March, which I think is originally kind of what we talked about. Maybe the first week is maybe what we had talked about. Are you still good on steel for that? 
**2:**
Yeah, as long as we get a contract so we can get some of this stuff purchased. Yeah, there. There's not an issue right now. 
**5:**
Yeah, you'll have one. 
**3:**
He. He. 
**5:**
He just sent us some markups for the office. I know he changed the mezzanine a little bit, so we. I literally just sent stuff back to him saying, hey, like, don't move this like that. 
**3:**
Yeah. 
**4:**
Okay. 
**0:**
We already. Brandon, we already shrunk that down a little bit. I think Jerome's working on them just to make sure. I think it was only a couple inches farther than what our mezzanine is, so we got to shrink down an office a little bit. 
**5:**
But, yeah, he just, he just sent it back. 
**0:**
Okay, Keith, we're expecting. And Brandon, correct me if I'm wrong, we're expecting a full release hopefully here in the middle of December at their board meeting. That's not. That's not too late, right? You can wait. 
**5:**
Yeah. Till then, I mean, we can get stuff released, right. Like, other stuff. The biggest thing is we just, you know, you know, we're changing stuff. Like we don't know the damn price. Right. Like, you know, because he's adding some walls and things like that. So we should have this pretty close here to where we can be like, all right, like, you know, here's what we've added, here's what we deleted. You know, here's a new price. Right. Let's build off this. 
**3:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Keith, I just had one question. I noticed here on these, they call for a 7 inch slab on grade. I know. I was looking at some past projects I've done. We've had a 6 inch slab. Is there a reason why is that? Because it's unre. Unreinforced. I'm. 
**2:**
Yeah, I mean, I think. 
**0:**
I think that's generally. 
**2:**
I think that's where we start at for going with unreinforced. I think that was what Chuck was talking about going through. And, you know, that's part of the getting the rack loads and the forklift loads and stuff like that. See if it can go to a 6 inch or unreinforced or, you know exactly what the best direction is. 
**1:**
Yes. 
**0:**
I gotta get. I'll get you that. That forklift and rack information. Okay. 
**2:**
Yeah, and I'm glad you were asking about it because I forgot we were still needing that, so. 
**0:**
No, I have it here from the past readings. I'm just going through my. My. My last note, so I will get that to you. 
**5:**
Okay? 
**2:**
